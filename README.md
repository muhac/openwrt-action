## Usage

1. `Fork` this repository.
2. Customize your firmware in `settings/.config` file. (optional)
3. `Commit` changes and `push` to GitHub to trigger the workflow.
4. Make a cup of coffee, and wait for the build to finish (about 1 hour).
5. Download firmware from `Actions/Artifacts` page.

## Build from other sources

You can choose to build from
[official OpenWrt](https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt),
[ImmortalWrt](https://github.com/immortalwrt/immortalwrt),
[Lean's source](https://github.com/coolsnowwolf/lede),
or any other repository and branch/tag.
Specify your choice in `build-openwrt.yml` file
[here](https://github.com/muhac/openwrt-action/blob/main/.github/workflows/build.yml#L60-L61).

Tiny modification may be needed if you want to build from other repositories.
I have my code tested building from
[ImmortalWrt](https://github.com/muhac/openwrt-action/tree/immortal) and
[Lean's source](https://github.com/muhac/openwrt-action/tree/leanlede).
You can find the corresponding branches in this repository.
